# Gym-Bot

Gym Bot is a workout assistant that reminds the user of doing a set of exercises. The hardware end of Gym Bot counts the number of push-ups being performed by the user. Gym Bot not only counts the number of push-ups in real-time and that too only if one performs the exercise correctly, but also automatically tweets about the number of push-ups one did that day. It is also installed with a timer and the Gym Bot assistant alarms one to switch to different types of exercises from time to time. And the moment the user starts exercising, the Gym Bot automatically plays music from a Youtube workout playlist.
