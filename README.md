# Gym-Bot
A complete workout assistant

## Inspiration
Automating a task was our inspiration behind building this project. We first thought of making a simple hardware project that only counts the number of push-ups an individual performs. But later, we collaborated and thought of making a complete workout assistant.

## What it does
Gym Bot not only counts the number of push-ups but also automatically tweets about the number of push-ups one did that day. It also is installed with a timer and alarm that reminds one to do different types of exercises, and at the same time plays music from a workout Youtube playlist.
